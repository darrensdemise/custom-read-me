  This Read-Me repo's code is made by bituq! (I do not have his permission)
  
  # 📖 How to customize:
  1. Scroll down to script.

  2. Copy raw materials (script).

  3. Make a new repo and name the repo with the exact letters of your GitHub username.

  4. Include Read-Me in the repo.

  5. ```Open repo -> Read-Me -> Edit```.

  6. Paste script.

  7. on ```<img src=... />``` you will need your own banner, to do that search SVG Banners on the GitHub website by Akshay090.

  8. Follow the instructions on that repo.

  9. Now after your SVG Banner is set, you can change the description below the banner.

  10. For ```My Skills``` you can add as many skills as you want.

  11. You will see ```|--|--|--|```, that is where your stats on the skill goes. So if your first skill is lua, and you're good at it, put ```|High|--|--|```. Remember, put the stats on the skill according to which skill goes.

  12. For ```Stats``` there will be ```<img src=... />```, you want to change the name on the link which should  be ```darrensdemise``` to your GitHub username. For timezone, ```timzone=(Your Continent)%2F(City)```.

  # 📌 Important things to understand
  It is HIGHLY recommended you are able to read and understand scripts, in order to easily customize the ```Read-Me``` Script. Again, this script is not made by me, I cannot script on GitHub just yet, but I have experience with scripting so I was able to customize the script from Bituq's ```Read-Me``` repo really easily.

  ## Fair Warning
  This repo is made by bituq since I can't program on GitHub yet because I am still trying to figure out GitHub's programming language for editing repo's.
